# LeRobot Dataset Visualizer

LeRobot Dataset Tool and Visualizer is a web application for interactive exploration and visualization of robotics datasets, particularly those in the LeRobot format. It enables users to browse, view, and analyze episodes from large-scale robotics datasets, combining synchronized video playback with rich, interactive data graphs.

## Project Overview

This tool is designed to help robotics researchers and practitioners quickly inspect and understand large, complex datasets. It fetches dataset metadata and episode data (including video and sensor/telemetry data), and provides a unified interface for:

- Navigating between organizations, datasets, and episodes
- Watching episode videos
- Exploring synchronized time-series data with interactive charts
- Analyzing action quality and identifying problematic episodes
- Visualizing robot poses in 3D using URDF models
- Paginating through large datasets efficiently

## Key Features

- **Dataset & Episode Navigation:** Quickly jump between organizations, datasets, and episodes using a sidebar and navigation controls.
- **Synchronized Video & Data:** Video playback is synchronized with interactive data graphs for detailed inspection of sensor and control signals.
- **Overview Panel:** At-a-glance summary of dataset metadata, camera info, and episode details.
- **Statistics Panel:** Dataset-level statistics including episode count, total recording time, frames-per-second, and an episode-length histogram.
- **Action Insights Panel:** Data-driven analysis tools to guide training configuration — includes autocorrelation, state-action alignment, speed distribution, and cross-episode variance heatmap.
- **Filtering Panel:** Identify and flag problematic episodes (low movement, jerky motion, outlier length) for removal. Exports flagged episode IDs as a ready-to-run LeRobot CLI command.
- **3D URDF Viewer:** Visualize robot joint poses frame-by-frame in an interactive 3D scene, with end-effector trail rendering. Supports SO-100, SO-101, and OpenArm bimanual robots.
- **Annotations Panel:** Hand-edit the v3.1 language schema (`language_persistent` + `language_events`) — subtask, plan, memory, interjection + paired speech, and VQA atoms with bounding-box / keypoint / count / attribute / spatial answers. VQA bboxes and keypoints render as overlays on the video player; drag or click on a camera to draw new ones. Backed by an optional FastAPI service (in `backend/`) for parquet rewrites and HF Hub push.
- **Efficient Data Loading:** Uses parquet and JSON loading for large dataset support, with pagination, chunking, and lazy-loaded panels for fast initial load.
- **Responsive UI:** Built with React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS for a fast, modern user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js** (App Router)
- **React**
- **Recharts** (for data visualization)
- **Three.js** + **@react-three/fiber** + **@react-three/drei** (for 3D URDF visualization)
- **urdf-loader** (for parsing URDF robot models)
- **hyparquet** (for reading Parquet files)
- **Tailwind CSS** (styling)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project uses [Bun](https://bun.sh) as its package manager. If you don't have it installed:

```bash
# Install Bun
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

### Installation

Install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

### Development

Run the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx` or other files in the `src/` directory. The app supports hot-reloading for rapid development.

### Browse a local dataset over HTTP

The visualizer expects datasets to be hosted with the same URL shape as Hugging Face Datasets:

```text
<DATASET_URL>/<repo_id>/resolve/main/<file>
```

To view a local dataset (e.g. <repo_id>=<org>/<setname>), use Caddy with the provided
[`Caddyfile`](./Caddyfile). Install Caddy first if needed:

```bash
brew install caddy
```

Then go to the root directory of your local datasets and start the Caddy server
with the `Caddyfile` from this repository:

```bash
cd <your-datasets-root>
caddy run --config <path-to-this-repo>/Caddyfile
```

The Caddy server automatically maps:

```text
http://localhost:8080/<org>/<setname>/resolve/main/meta/info.json
```

to:

```text
<your-datasets-root>/<org>/<setname>/meta/info.json
```

The provided `Caddyfile` also sends the CORS headers needed by the browser.
It allows `http://localhost:${PORT}` when `PORT` is set, and defaults to
`http://localhost:3000` when `PORT` is unset.

Then start the visualizer with the local dataset host:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_DATASET_URL=http://localhost:8080 bun run dev
```

If you run the visualizer on a different port, pass the same `PORT` value to
both Caddy and Next.js:

```bash
PORT=3001 caddy run --config <path-to-this-repo>/Caddyfile
PORT=3001 NEXT_PUBLIC_DATASET_URL=http://localhost:8080 bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Other Commands

```bash
# Build for production
bun run build

# Start production server
bun start

# Run linter
bun run lint

# Format code
bun run format
```

### Environment Variables

- `DATASET_URL`: (optional) Server-side base URL for dataset hosting (defaults to HuggingFace Datasets).
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_DATASET_URL`: (optional) Browser-visible base URL for dataset hosting. Set this with `DATASET_URL` when serving datasets from a local HTTP host such as `http://localhost:8080`.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_REPO_ID`: (optional) Dataset id to open automatically from the home page, for example `<org>/<setname>`.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_EPISODES`: (optional) Space-separated episode ids used by the home page redirect; the first valid id is opened.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ANNOTATE_BACKEND_URL`: (optional) URL of the FastAPI annotation
  backend (`backend/app.py`). When set, the Annotations tab can save edits and
  rewrite parquet shards / push to the Hub. When unset the tab is read/edit
  only with sessionStorage persistence.

## Annotations backend (optional)

The Annotations tab edits LeRobot v3.1 language atoms — `language_persistent`
(broadcast subtask/plan/memory) and `language_events` (per-frame
interjection / vqa / speech) — and renders existing bbox/keypoint atoms over
the video player. Edits live in `sessionStorage` by default; to write the
new columns into `data/chunk-*/file-*.parquet` (matching the writer in
[lerobot#3471](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot/pull/3471)) and push the
result to the Hub, run the bundled FastAPI service:

```bash
# 1. install + start the backend (port 7861 by default)
cd backend
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app:app --port 7861 --reload

# 2. start the visualizer with the backend URL configured
cd ..
NEXT_PUBLIC_ANNOTATE_BACKEND_URL=http://127.0.0.1:7861 bun run dev
```

The backend exposes:

- `POST /api/dataset/load` — load a dataset by `repo_id` or `local_path`
- `GET  /api/episodes/{ep}/atoms` — list atoms for an episode
- `POST /api/episodes/{ep}/atoms` — replace atoms (event timestamps are
  snapped to exact source-frame timestamps before persisting)
- `GET  /api/episodes/{ep}/frame_timestamps` — used client-side for snapping
- `POST /api/export` — rewrite parquet with the new language columns plus
  the dataset-level `tools` column (drops legacy `subtask_index`)
- `POST /api/push_to_hub` — export and push to a target repo

## Docker Deployment
